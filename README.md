- On the next window click *Create new* and name the profile anything you want, then click *Create*.
- After you've created the profile, click on it and then click *Select Profile*.
- Click on the *Online* tab on the left and in the search bar at the top search for ```MrhumaPack```.
- Click on ```MrhumaPack``` and click *Download* then *Download with dependencies*.
- Once it's downloaded click on *Start Modded* at the top left and boot the game until you reach the main menu.
- We do this initial boot so that it can generate the folders needed for the custom music.

# Setup Custom Music
- In the mod manager, click on *Settings* -> *Browse Profile Folder*.
- This will open a file explorer, in the file explorer open the *BepInEx* -> *Custom Songs* -> *Boombox Music* folders.
- This is where the music will be placed. Now we need to download the music.
- Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Mrhuma/LCBoomboxTunes/releases) for this repo and download the ```LCBoomboxTunes.zip```.
- Open the zip you just downloaded and move all the mp3 files into the *Boombox Music* folder.
